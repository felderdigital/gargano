a_1 = "Dr. Gargano developed the Yin-Yang technique after discovering there was a real need for it in reconstructive surgery.  He set out to create a template for the ideal breast reduction technique that would yield a natural, proportional and  youthful contour of the breast. The Yin-Yang technique is backed by years of research and supported by multiple peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Gargano has successfully performed the technique on hundreds of patients."
a_2 = "Conventional breast reduction techniques often widen the breast’s base, creating lower breast projection. Also, long-term results are often unpredictable.  Dr. Gargano’s groundbreaking Yin-Yang technique narrows the breast base, in turn allowing for more breast projection and a higher, more youthful breast."
a_title = "Why the Yin-Yang breast reduction technique is better than other techniques"
b_1 = "The procedure gets its name from incisions that are made similar to the shape of the Chinese symbol.  Dr. Gargano first makes incisions around the nipples and along the breasts. He then removes excess breast tissue, raises two dermoglandular flaps and reshapes the anatomic breast, suturing the two flaps together. Dr. Gargano developed this technique with the modern-day woman in mind. It is unobtrusive and requires little to no downtime.  He performs this outpatient procedure using a general anesthetic, allowing patients to quickly resume their day-to-day activities."
b_2 = "The Yin-Yang technique can also be used in a ‘mommy makeover’ to restore the breast and reverse the effects of childbearing. The technique is useful to lift up the breast and hold an implant to compensate for missing volume."
b_title = "Dr. Gargano’s Yin-Yang technique delivers immediate and long-lasting results"
c_1 = "Two flaps are inset with opposite spiral movements, the nipple is transposed to the new position, the LBIP flap is advanced and rotated towards the parasternal line and sutured to hold the lower pole position."
d_1 = "In combined mastopexy and augmentation the implant is held in its anatomical position by the lower pole flap. This guarantees lower pole stability and prevents double bouble deformity."

a_1 = "While many women wish their breasts were larger, there’s a point where breast size can be a burden instead of an asset.
